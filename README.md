# Resources for Post-6.00.1x 

## Fundamentals:
* The Elements of Computing Systems (also known as ‘Nand to Tetris’)
  * This book gets you to build a computer from the transistor up. You end up creating your own compiler, dealing with Assembly etc. It can really help improve your knowledge of the fundamentals of computers.

* CODE by Charles Petzold
  * This book is all about code. Not just computer code. It begins with Morse and Braille. Then it introduces binary systems, and ends up teaching how a computer is made from the base up. It deals with very fundamental concepts such as flip-flops (not the beach wear) and goes up to teaching compilers and introducing graphical user interfaces.

## Web Development:
* CS50: Web Development with Python and JavaScript
  * This course begins with HTML and CSS and gradually moves on to Flask for back-end programming, deals with Ajax and then moves onto more sophisticated frameworks such as Django. It also touches on security and scalability.

## Data Science:
* Web Scraping with Python: Collecting More Data from the Modern Web
  * You can use web scraping to gather a bunch of data, this book teaches you HTML parsing, and more.

* Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow
  * This book teaches practical machine learning. It doesn’t spend too much time with the theory as other machine learning books. Here’s a video reviewing the book: youtu.be/1RiFIYwuwHM

* Data Analysis with Python
  * saskeli.github.io/data-analysis-with-python-summer-2019/index.html

## Math:
* Mathematics for Computer Science (MIT Opencourseware)
  * Pretty self-explanatory. It’s some math that is important to major parts of computer science.

* Art of Problem Solving series
  * Not computer science specific, but I enjoy the teaching method that these books follow. The books range from basic arithmetic to calculus.

* Introduction to Algorithms
  * ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm
  * The course follows this book: mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition

## Other:
* Weekly Emails about Python (involves interesting projects, articles and news)
  * www.pythonweekly.com
* C Programming – Absolute Beginner’s Guide
  * Learning another language can be useful. C is a language that many modern languages have at their root, so learning it is useful.
  * www.amazon.com/dp/0789751984/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_AlDsDbGXRM4X0
* CS50 Mobile Development
  * This course assumes knowledge of HTML and CSS. It is a nice follow-on to CS50 Web Development with Python and JavaScript but it can be taken without it. The course focuses on React Native to develop cross-platform mobile applications.
